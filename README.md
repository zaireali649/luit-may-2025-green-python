Welcome to the **May 2025 Green Cohort** of Level Up In Tech!

This repository is dedicated to our journey as we learn **Python for the first time**. All code examples, practice scripts, and demos from our **live coaching calls** will be committed here to track progress, reinforce learning, and build a portfolio of Python projects.

## 🐍 Purpose

- Learn the fundamentals of Python programming
- Practice writing clean, readable code
- Apply Python to DevOps and AWS-related tasks
- Build confidence working with real code examples
- Create a reference for future Python use in technical roles
